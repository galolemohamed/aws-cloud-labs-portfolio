AWS Auditing and Monitoring Hands-on Lab Over the past few days, 
I’ve been deepening my cloud security skills by completing several AWS hands-on labs focused on auditing, monitoring, and securing AWS environments. 
Here’s what I covered: 
Reviewed IAM user permissions to identify overly permissive roles. 
Used the AWS IAM Policy Simulator to validate access controls and enforce least privilege. 
Audited EC2 Security Groups for inbound and outbound traffic exposures. 
Reviewed VPC configurations, subnets, and Network ACLs to ensure proper segmentation. 
Monitored system health and metrics using Amazon CloudWatch. 
Analyzed CloudTrail logs in Amazon S3 to trace API activity and detect unusual behavior. 
This lab have strengthened my understanding of how to: 
Audit AWS accounts effectively Enforce security best practices Monitor infrastructure performance and compliance I’m continuing to build my expertise in AWS Cloud Security, Auditing, and Monitoring as I prepare for advanced certifications and real-world applications.
