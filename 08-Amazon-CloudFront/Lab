AWS Cloud Journey Update Lab Completed!

 Amazon CloudFront

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed another Lab : Amazon CloudFront, where I learned how AWS securely delivers content across the globe with high performance and low latency.

 What I Built

Stored a publicly accessible image in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Created a CloudFront web distribution to deliver the image globally through AWS edge locations.

Tested the CloudFront URL to verify faster content delivery.

Deleted resources (CloudFront & S3) to ensure proper cost management and cleanup.

Key Takeaways  

Amazon CloudFront acts as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches data at edge locations, reducing latency for users worldwide.

Integrating S3 with CloudFront improves scalability, performance, and security for web applications.

Understanding CDN behavior is essential for cloud architects and security engineers optimizing global delivery.

This hands-on lab strengthened my foundation in AWS networking, caching, and global content delivery  a key step toward my AWS Solutions Architect Associate goal.
