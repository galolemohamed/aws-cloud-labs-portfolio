# AWS Lab 7 â€“ Lambda + API Gateway

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a serverless AWS Lambda function triggered by an API Gateway REST endpoint. The Lambda function serves random FAQ entries, showcasing event-driven architecture and serverless computing concepts.

## Key Accomplishments
- Created a Lambda function that serves random FAQ entries.
- Configured an API Gateway REST endpoint to trigger the Lambda function.
- Tested the Lambda function via API endpoint and Lambda console test events.
- Monitored Lambda execution using CloudWatch logs.

## What I Learned
- Serverless computing: Run code without managing servers; automatic scaling based on events.
- Event-driven architecture: Lambda responds to triggers like API calls, S3 uploads, DynamoDB updates, and more.
- Stateless functions: Stateless design ensures scalable execution.
- Monitoring & debugging: CloudWatch logs provide detailed insights into execution and performance.
- Integration skills: API Gateway allows HTTP access to Lambda functions.


## How to Test
1. Deploy the Lambda function in your AWS account.
2. Create an API Gateway REST endpoint to trigger the Lambda function.
3. Invoke the API endpoint in a browser or via 'curl'
