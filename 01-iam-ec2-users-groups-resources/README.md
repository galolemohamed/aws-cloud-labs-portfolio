#  AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Lab 01  
## EC2, Users, Groups, and Resources

I successfully completed my first AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Lab.  
It was a great opportunity to practice what I’ve been learning by applying real-world scenarios.

---

###  What I Worked On
- Creating and managing IAM users.  
- Assigning users to groups with specific permissions (S3-Support, EC2-Support, EC2-Admin).  
- Practicing least privilege access by restricting users from performing actions outside their roles.  
- Logging in as different users to test permissions.  
- Attempting real actions like starting/stopping EC2 instances to validate security controls.

---

###  Key Takeaway
Cloud security starts with the principle of least privilege 
giving users only the access they need and nothing more.

This practical exercise reinforced my understanding of:
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Permissions and resource control
- EC2 instance management

Essential skills for any Cloud Practitioner or AWS Solutions Architect in the making.

###  What’s Next
I’m excited to keep building on this foundation as I progress toward my **AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification**.
