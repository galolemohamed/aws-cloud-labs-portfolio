#  AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey – Lab 6 Completed!
## High Availability and Auto Scaling with Amazon EC2

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed Lab 6: High Availability and Auto Scaling with Amazon EC2. 
This lab was a deep dive into building resilient, scalable, and highly available cloud infrastructure using core AWS services.

###  What I Accomplished

#### Task 1 – Create and Use Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
- Created a custom AMI from an existing EC2 instance for fast, consistent deployments.  
- Learned how AMIs enable rapid recovery and infrastructure consistency.

#### Task 2 – Set Up an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Deployed an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming web traffic.  
- Configured target groups and verified traffic routing between EC2 instances.  
- Observed improved fault tolerance and load distribution.

#### Task 3 – Configure Launch Templates and Auto Scaling Groups
- Built a Launch Template to define instance configuration settings.  
- Created an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) that automatically scales instances based on demand.  
- Simulated traffic spikes to watch the ASG scale out and in dynamically.

#### Task 4 – Monitor and Automate with CloudWatch
- Created Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor CPU utilization.  
- Integrated alarms with the Auto Scaling Group to trigger automatic scaling events.  
- Validated automatic scaling in action during simulated workload stress tests.
