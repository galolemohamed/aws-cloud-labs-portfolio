#  AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey – Lab 5 Completed!  
## Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

I completed Lab 5: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service),  
where I gained hands-on experience deploying and managing a fully managed database in the cloud.

This lab helped me understand how RDS simplifies database administration through automation, scalability, and built-in security — all essential for cloud-based applications.

###  What I Accomplished

#### Task 1 – Launch an Amazon RDS DB Instance
- Created an RDS instance with high availability enabled (Multi-AZ deployment).  
- Chose a database engine suitable for production workloads.  
- Configured instance size, storage, and backup settings.

#### Task 2 – Configure Secure Access
- Set up a DB subnet group to control which subnets the database can run in.  
- Attached a security group to restrict inbound traffic and allow only trusted sources.  
- Used VPC networking to ensure private, isolated database access.

#### Task 3 – Connect from a Web Server
- Launched an EC2 web server within the same VPC.  
- Configured application environment variables to connect to the RDS endpoint.  
- Successfully connected and interacted with the database directly from the browser.
