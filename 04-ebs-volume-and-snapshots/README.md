# ðŸ’½ AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey â€“ Lab 4 Completed!

## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) â€“ Volumes and Snapshots

Iâ€™m excited to share my progress in Lab 4, where I gained hands-on experience with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) â€” the persistent storage service for Amazon EC2.  
This lab gave me a strong foundation in volume management, data durability, and disaster recovery, which are essential for maintaining resilient cloud infrastructure.

###  What I Accomplished

#### Task 1 â€“ Create and Attach an EBS Volume
- Created a new Amazon EBS Volume.
- Attached the volume to an existing EC2 instance.

#### Task 2 â€“ Mount and Format the Volume
- Mounted the EBS volume to the EC2 instance.
- Configured and formatted a file system on the new volume.

#### Task 3 â€“ Store Data and Test Persistence
- Created and stored a test file on the EBS volume.
- Stopped and restarted the EC2 instance to verify data persistence.

#### Task 4 â€“ Create a Snapshot
- Created a snapshot of the EBS volume, providing a reliable backup point.

#### Task 5 â€“ Restore from Snapshot
- Created a new volume from the snapshot.
- Attached and mounted it to the same EC2 instance.
- Verified that the test file was still intact, confirming data recovery worked successfully.
